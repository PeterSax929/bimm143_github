## 1. Introduction to PDB

The main repository of bio-molecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB). It is the second oldest database ever (after GenBank)

What is currently in the PDB? We can access current composition stats [here](https://www.rcsb.org/stats)

```{r}
pdb.stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdb.stats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x){
  y <- gsub(",","",x)
  return(sum(as.numeric(y)))}

(comma.sum(pdb.stats$X.ray) + comma.sum(pdb.stats$EM)) / (comma.sum(pdb.stats$Total)) * 100
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
comma.sum(pdb.stats["Protein (only)","Total"]) / comma.sum(pdb.stats[,"Total"])
```

## 2. Visualizing with Mol-star

Mol (pronounced “molstar”) is a new web-based molecular viewer that is rapidly gaining in popularity and utility. At the time of writing it is still a long way from having the full feature set of stand-alone molecular viewer programs like VMD, PyMol or Chimera. However, it is gaining new features all the time and does not require any download or complicated installation.

## 4. Comparative Structure Analysis

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```
```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
attributes(blast)
hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
head(hits$pdb.id)
```
```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
#files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
#pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)
```



```{r}
#pc <- pca(pdbs)
#plot(pc)
```


Write a PDB "trajectory" for mol-star

```{r}
#mktrj(pc, file="pca_results.pdb")
```
